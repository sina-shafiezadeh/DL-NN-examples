## Deep Learning and Neural Network Course

This repository contains four exercises designed to help you practice machine learning concepts and deep learning techniques using the Python programming language and the PyTorch framework. The exercises cover both supervised and unsupervised learning models, and are based on the course "Deep Learning and Neural Networks" held in the academic year 2021-2022 at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova.

Whether you are a student or a researcher in the field of machine learning and deep learning, this repository can be a great resource to help you improve your basic skills and knowledge. You can access the exercises and materials in this repository to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques in PyTorch and apply them to your own data.

I hope that you find this repository useful and that it helps you achieve your learning goals. Please feel free to contribute to this repository by adding your own code examples, suggesting improvements, or fixing any issues you find. Thank you for visiting our repository!
